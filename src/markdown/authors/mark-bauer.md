I'm originally from the Philadelphia area, but I moved out here a few years ago to work as a Product Designer for Box. As far as design goes, I consider myself to be a generalist. Iâ€™m interested in designing for a wide range of mediums and developing my skills in every phase of of the design process, from early iteration and testing all the way through creating beautiful visuals. 

As far as not-design goes, I live in the Mission and even though I love San Francisco, one of my favorite things to do is get out of the city and explore all of the outdoorsy things that Northern California has to offer. I'm also interested in cars, drawing, and playing chess.
