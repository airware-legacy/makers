I'm a Software Engineer on the Airware cloud team. There I'm responsible for working on the front end. Prior to Airware, I worked at Amazon and Dow Jones on web and mobile technologies.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from New Jersey Institute of Technology. In my spare time I like to mess around with new front-end frameworks, develop video games, and hike in the Bay Area.
