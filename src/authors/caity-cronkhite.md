As Airware’s Technical Writer, I am responsible for documenting Airware’s technology so customers can be successful. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in Technical Writing and Linguistics from Carnegie Mellon University.

Prior to Airware, I specialized in information architecture and technical documentation at SalesForce. In my spare time, I enjoy road trips, bodybuilding, tutoring, and mentoring adult students who are pursuing careers in technology.
