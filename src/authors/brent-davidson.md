I’ve always been building things. Growing up in rural Wisconsin, my best was taking my childhood tree fort and building it into my teenage tiny-apartment. We hosted the best parties in town.

In journalism school I got hooked on design by working on news products with CS students. I then spent two and a half years working on financial software at Intuit. Now at Airware I’m designing the next generation of aviation, and working with Mark to create a design team that influences our design and our business.

Outside of design I’m obsessed with human and wind powered sports. You’ll find me mountain and road biking around the whole bay area, kiteboarding the bay and ocean, and piloting sailplanes with the Northern California Soaring Association.
