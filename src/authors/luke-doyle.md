I'm a Software Engineer on Airware's front-end team. Prior to Airware, I spent two years in Tokyo working on a cutting-edge industrial robotics platform.

While an undergrad at RPI, I helped develop an intra-wing robotic inspection system for Boeing, as well as an experimental X-ray optic production facility at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

Outside my passion is robotics, running, cycling, sailing, bad puns, building furniture, and is a voracious consumer of podcasts.
