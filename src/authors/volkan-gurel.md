At Airware, I am Manager of the Cloud Backend team. Prior to Airware, I was the infrastructure lead for the Merchandising Backend at eBay New York. There I architected and built a new system for capturing, processing and serving real-time user data at scale, improved site reliability and speed, and lead a wide range of backend projects.

I have dual Bachelor Degrees in Computer Science and in Operations Research from MIT. In my free time, I enjoy mountaineering, skiing, and biking.
