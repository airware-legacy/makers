I lead embedded development at Airware. My background is in the medical device industry. Before I joined Airware, I worked at Avinger in a variety of roles, including Director of R&D – Software and Systems, where I developed a high-speed, real-time OCT imaging system to allow physicians to view the insides of arteries.

Prior to joining Avinger, I was a Senior Software Engineer at St. Jude Medical and DEKA Research & Development. In my free time, I am an amateur pilot-—he has over a hundred hours in the left seat of a Piper Warrior.
