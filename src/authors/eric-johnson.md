I grew up in Boston and moved to the Bay Area in 2013. I'm a veteran of 4 enterprise-facing startups. I consider myself both a technologist and an enthusiastic people manager. I've hired amazing teams, started departments, and shipped a ton of product.

When not at work I love writing code, running, biking, swimming, and spending time with my wife and daughter in the East Bay.
