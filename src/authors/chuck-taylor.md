I'm a UAV Systems Engineer at Airware. Acting as an in-house customer, I integrate and tests the latest hardware and software across a variety of vehicles in order to ensure its functionality and safety. Previously, I worked for NAVMAR Applied Sciences as an R&D pilot and mission commander flying the Tigershark unmanned aircraft

I have over 15 years of experience flying remote controlled aircraft and has accumulated over 1,000 hours flying unmanned aircraft. I received my commercial pilotâ€™s license from University of North Dakota while studying Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations.
