As Senior Test Automation Engineer at Airware, I drive the test automation efforts for our cloud platform. Prior to Airware, I worked at Tidemark, doing full-stack test automation and lead multiple feature releases.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Mahidol University International College, Thailand. I spend my spare time on coffee, music and value investing.
